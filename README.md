# chat-bar-interaction

I was just checking some instagram posts and found this interesting chat bar interaction by [](). Just wanted to experiement with css animations as it's been a while I have tried them.

Just a quick implementation, feel free to check the author page as it have other beautiful UX designs!

Here is the link to instagram post and author is: [Oleg Frolov](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu3Ek9OheRU/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=znkv2bc2rn2m).

All the icons are by [Sebastien Gabriel](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/sebastien-gabriel) taken from [flat icon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and changed the background color just to match the theme.

Feel free to advise something, if I can tweek some animations in better way.

The chat window is "Zoomed to 2", incase you want to use it in normal size please remove "zoom: 2;" in main.css on line number: 74.
